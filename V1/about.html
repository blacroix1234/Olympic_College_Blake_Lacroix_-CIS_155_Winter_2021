<!--Content above is from V1. I was trying to get a solid basis for
how the page was going to be set up. I knew I wanted everything centered
at least for the body. I knew I wanted links at the top and bottom but was
unsure how to style this to accomidate that, so I opted for just putting
them at the bottom for now. I added a picture for a placeholder, felt 
cool, might delete later, lol. I used Lorem Ipsum for a lot of my text, 
as I dont have exactly what I want to be on there just yet. I'll be working
on that this next week. I'm excited to see what else I can make of this
page. I will be utilizing the margins, maybe on both sides. But definetly
on the left side of page for a navigation or hyperlink area to outside pages.-->
